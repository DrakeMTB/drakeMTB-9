Race Jersey and Shorts (aka Team Kit) – Order deadline November 15, 2015
Every rider must race in his or her team jersey. The shorts are optional but most choose to purchase at least both the jersey and the shorts. The NorCal League and individual teams negotiate a great discount on the kits, however they are still expensive. The rider only needs one kit but is welcome to order as much as they want. And, the kits are not limited to racers; anyone is welcome to place an order. 

Every 2 years, kits are redesigned and new sponsor logos are added. Currently, the kits are scheduled to be redesigned on even years; 2016, 2018… So, if your child doesn’t grow out of their kit, it can possibly be used for 2 years.
