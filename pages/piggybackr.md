Each year, every rider participates in soliciting donations from friends and family through a website they build and share. Piggybackr is the platform to build the website and collect the donations. 

If riders choose to not participate in the Piggybackr Fundraising effort, $250 will be added to the Team Donations/Dues collected from the families. We have found that the riders have been extremely successful in their fundraising efforts by contacting their family and friends of their parents to ask for small donations in the $10-20 range. If each team member raises about $250, then collectively we will have risen $12-$13K - a huge help in funding our $50K budget.
