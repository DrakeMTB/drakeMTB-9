Drake MTB is committed to helping any high school rider who is willing to commit the time and make the effort to learn the sport of mountain biking and participate in races.  

If a rider needs a significant amount of coaching attention the Coaches may deem a rider ineligible to participate on the team.  

The Drake MTB Hill Climb, an activity used to determine a riderâ€™s physical ability, carries a minimum 25 minute completion time. If your rider is new to the sport or has not ridden before, we recommend doing a pre-assessment ride prior to your commitment to team participation. Please contact the head Coach or Director for more details. 

Mountain biking is a dangerous sport, and riders are exposed to situations and elements that are difficult to control.  The team has limited financial and coaching resources and may not have the ability to properly and safely monitor riders that require one-on-one supervision.

In any situation, we will work with parents to try to come up with a plan, if feasible (and sometimes with additional support from parents or third parties) to allow kids to participate on the team.  Participation on the team is not, however, guaranteed.
