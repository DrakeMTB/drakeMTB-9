**Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about participating in the Drake MTB Team:**

###What is the training like?
The training starts out gradual in the late fall and increases in duration and intensity until around March or April when the duration steadies. We create a training schedule for student athletes to be in peak performance shape at the championship races. 

###Are riders taught about bike safety and preparedness?
Yes. Drake MTB has a team technician to assist in some mechanical issues and to provide some instruction. We also go over and enforce proper road use including lane positioning, signage, and group formation.

###Are riders supervised during the whole ride?
No. The nature of mountain biking is such that it is impossible to keep your eyes on each rider all the time. Some will ride behind the coach, others in front. Also, some riders “turn back” early if they have other commitments that they need to attend. During those times, the rider is NOT under supervision. If this is an unacceptable situation for your family, then Drake MTB is NOT for you.

###What are the races like?
The courses are cross-country courses. Since Drake riders train on Mt. Tam and in Camp Tamarancho, they generally find the courses at races to be easy. Frosh riders can expect to race about 10-12 miles, while Varsity boys can race up to 28 miles. Besides that, we all put on Pirate tattoos and have a blast.

###How good of a bike is needed?
Almost any bike in good repair, with the proper components will do. If you are considering purchasing a bike, please feel free to talk to a coach or consult with our Official Team Shop, Sunshine. 

###What is the practice schedule?
By January, the practice schedule is Tue, Thu, Sun, with recommended spin on Wednesday and optional yoga on Monday nights.

###Can I still play on another sports team at Drake?
No. We have allowed student athletes to participate a second sport in the past and we have found its too tiring to train for 2 sports; the rider is exhausted, unable to make the minimum team requirements and both team coaches end up frustrated. 

###How much might this cost me?
While we have made great strides in reducing the cost of participation over the years, a rider should still expect to pay over $1,300 for the season when bike maintenance, uniform, meals, licensing and other items are factored in.

###When does the season start?
The “season” is a bit different from other sports. We start in October, we do some light preparation for training in November, start riding more in December, and by January we are fully into training for the first race in early March.

###Are there unofficial training rides? When and where?
There are no unofficial training rides sanctioned by Drake MTB. However, Drake riders are encouraged and expected to buddy up and ride with their peers informally when rides are not scheduled.

###Are there official training rides and workouts?
Yes, please refer to the Team Ride Schedule and Team Calendar.

###If you want to ride on your own, can you recommend some routes?
There are many routes to choose from. Drake MTB recommends getting a Marin County Bicycle Coalition map from Sunshine Bicycle Center in Fairfax and familiarizing yourself with local routes emanating from Fairfax. 

###What kind of a bike, components, equipment will a rider need?
Bikes are personal items that can be very expensive, so there is no blanket recommendation that will fit the needs of every rider’s family. However, we can say this: 

•	Frames are generally the same on any bike, but fit is very important. Please consult a shop expert on fit. We recommend a “hardtail” frame with front suspension.
•	Components: these can range from inexpensive and fragile to expensive and super light. We recommend some mid-range components (e.g. Shimano LX or XT) as a minimum for withstanding a season of use, but understand that families must make their own decisions.
•	For safety reasons, all riders MUST have helmet, gloves, eye-wear, padded shorts (baggies are fine!), bike shoes, and CLIPLESS pedals (there is a learning curve, but you’ll thank us later). A complement of non-cotton clothing is necessary, including layers for very cold winter rides. Each rider must also have a basic repair kit of pump, tire levers, patches and/or tube, and multi-use tool.

###Can riders of all different levels participate?
Yes!!! Please read Team Eligibility requirements for more details.

###Can someone ride and train with the team and then not race?
No. All riders must make a minimum commitment to participate in races; 3 of 6 during the season.

###Who are the coaches and how do I get in touch with them?
See the “Coaches” link on the website for emails and phone numbers.

###What bike shop do you deal with and do they give a team discount?
Drake MTB is sponsored exclusively by Sunshine Bicycle Center in Fairfax. They have been serving the Drake Community since 1971, and Drake MTB since it inception. 

###What advice to you have for someone who is new to the sport or doesn’t know many people who ride?
When the little voice in your head starts giving you reasons for not coming out to ride, ignore it, and meet us, or just push yourself out the door and get on that bike.

###Can you tell us at the beginning of the season where and when the races will be?
The final race schedule will be posted on the NorCal website in January. See www.norcalmtb.org

###What about transportation and accommodations at the races?
Riders and their families are entirely responsible for transportation to and from races. As a matter of policy, Drake MTB staff may not carry riders to or from races. The NorCal League usually publicizes accommodations near the races should you decide to stay the night. Many families look for places to camp.
