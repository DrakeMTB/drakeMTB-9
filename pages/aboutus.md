<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>It was a spring day in 2002, when a Drake High sophomore and Drake teacher found themselves competing against each other unexpectedly at a race infamously known as Billy Cross. It was a classic match-up of student versus master every bit as great as Vader vs. Kenobi. They fought, struggled, and even trash-talked to gain cycling supremacy at Drake High, the only high school in the country to produce not one but two national collegiate cycling champions. The stakes were high. What happened on that day is the stuff of legend. Some will say that the kid showed up the master by beating him to the line. Others deny, saying the kid only had to do two laps, and the old timer, three. Not a fair comparison.</p>

<p>But, what we do know is from that meeting came the birth of the Drake Mountain Bike Team. In December of 2002 we had our first meeting. That spring, 8 Pirates came out to race. By the spring of 2009, Drake had earned the title of 2004 and 2006 NorCal State Champions. And, finally, in 2009 Drake won the first-ever California State Championship, the first of five (as of  2015), bringing high school mountain biking’s most prestigious honor to where it truly belongs…at the foot of Repack and Mt. Tamalpais.

<h1>Charter</h1>

<p>Mission Statement</p>

<p>To provide coaching and camaraderie to students that have the desire to mountain bike so as to help them achieve both competitive and non-competitive cross-country goals in a safe and enjoyable manner.</p>

<p>Club Goals</p>

<ol>
	<li>To give beginner riders an understanding of our sport and to give them a fun and challenging cycling experience.</li>
	<li>To have the intermediate riders advance in racing categories (i.e., beginner, sport and expert).</li>
	<li>To have the advanced riders increase proficiency and develop and earn top honors at races.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rules and Regulations Of Our Club</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Never take risks.</strong> This is the number one rule; athletes that have a risk taking attitude or are witnessed to take risks will not be tolerated. A risk is defined as willingly attempting anything, which is beyond one&rsquo;s ability to control in a safe manner.</li>
	<li><strong>Always Yield.</strong> Even if at times it seems inconvenient. Being sensitive to how others perceive you will assure a positive image for your sport and minimize the restrictions that follow confrontations and negative encounters. Remember that bicycles in the backcountry are a new experience for horses and hikers.</li>
	<li><strong>Pass with Care.</strong> Let others know of your presence well in advance. Use a chime or audible greeting to avoid startling others. Be especially careful when passing a horse, as each will react differently; stop and ask the rider for instructions. By asking if the horse is easily spooked, you show an awareness of the rider&rsquo;s needs. Sometimes it may be necessary to dismount and remove your bike from the trail to allow others to pass.</li>
	<li><strong>Stay on Trails.</strong> Riding off-trail damages meadows and other fragile ecosystems. Never cut switchbacks as this accelerates erosion. Beware the types of soil you are riding on. Never ride on muddy trails and carry your bicycle around muddy spots.</li>
	<li><strong>Control your speed.</strong> Safe speed is relative to terrain and your experience as a rider. Be able to stop safely without skidding in the distance that you can see ahead. Approach switchbacks and turns in anticipation of someone coming around the bend.</li>
	<li><strong>Respect Wildlife and livestock.</strong> Do not frighten animals. Close gates as you pass through, unless it appears obvious that they have been intentionally left open.</li>
	<li><strong>Do Not Litter.</strong> Pack out what you pack in, and if possible, carry out more than your share.</li>
	<li><strong>Ride Only on Authorized Trails.</strong> Check with <a href="http://marinwater.org/"><strong>local authorities</strong></a> regarding open trails and conditions, and with landowners regarding private land access. Stay off trails that are closed to bicycles.</li>
	<li><strong>Plan Ahead.</strong> The off-road bicycle will open new horizons to you. Some of these should be approached with respect. If distances are involved, do not travel solo. Expect weather changes. Leave word where you plan to go and when you plan to return.</li>
	<li><strong>Minimize Impacts.</strong> The practice of minimum impact wilderness use is the philosophy of responsible off-road cyclists. Take only pictures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WEAR A HELMET AT ALL TIMES.</strong></p>
