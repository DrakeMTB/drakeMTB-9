title: Parent Committee Meetings

Meetings are schedule for the 1st Tuesday of the Month in the Drake Student Center at 7pm. If there is no school on the first Tuesday of the month, then the meeting is usually rescheduled for the next Tuesday school is in session. Please refer to the team calendar on the Home Page for date confirmation. 

The purpose of the meetings is to create an opportunity to share news about upcoming events, help plan for those events and get involved to help support team activities. All are welcome and encouraged to attend. We try to limit the meetings to one hour but you often see parents sticking around for a while after catching up with one another. 
Drake Mountain biking has been a powerhouse in cycling for the past 15 years because of our parents.  We are well organized, enthusiastic, friendly and involved.  We need a village to operate the club with fundraising, a couple parties, and the races (food, feed zones, cheering, video clips, etc). Hope you can make it!
