title: Team Donation and Dues
permalink: /dues/
---

**The** amount **rider dues** will be determined by **November 1st** and communicated to parents. The dues will be collected during the month of December. The amount of the dues will be determined by what is not possible to raise from outside donations such as sponsorships, **Piggybackr**, **Iron Springs Give Back Tuesday** and the **bike raffle**. So, the more we can raise from outside sources, the less each family pays. In the past, the fundraising efforts have been very successful and the family amount is not much more than what the team pays to register each rider for the races ($55/race).
