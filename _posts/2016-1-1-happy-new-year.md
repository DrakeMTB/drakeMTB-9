A HUGE Welcome to the 2016 Drake MTB Season! We are very excited about this year and the upcoming race season. We wish to welcome the new riders and welcome back the previous riders.

There is so much to look forward to this year, New team kits! New Racing locations! Pelo, Yoga! and of course training rides!

We want to welcome the "Jim Miller Memorial Fund" and huge thanks to the "old spokes" for their support to the Drake Team this year!
